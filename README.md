This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`ruby`](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/) (not to be confused with any official `ruby` image provided by `ruby` upstream). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [the `ruby` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/ruby).

For outstanding `ruby` image PRs, check [PRs with the "library/ruby" label on the official-images repository](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/labels/library%2Fruby). For the current "source of truth" for [`ruby`](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/), see [the `library/ruby` file in the official-images repository](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/ruby).
